# LAB - 11

## BusMall
You’ve been hired by a startup called BusMall, whose product is similar to the SkyMall catalog found in the seatback pockets on airplanes. BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest… before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion. BusMall wants you to build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side). The app’s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.
