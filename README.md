## Reflections and Comments
+ Original set up with tricky since I couldn't figure out (ran out of time) on how to adjust for the different image file extensions
+ The writing to the DOM was done properly so gaining some confidence on that process
+ Still finding some logic gaps on when we run counters and exactly where to place them; probaly need to step back and walk through the logic more carefully
+ I really like how Lena scaffolded the tasks/sub-tasks as comments and then filled out each section step by step; I need to incoroporate this into my own coding until I get more experience with it. For future reference, see lecture 12 on the initial Bus Mall set-up.
